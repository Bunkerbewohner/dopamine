    <h1>Dopamine</h1>

    <section>
        <p>
            Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure, motivation, and learning. It is released in
            response to natural rewards such
            as food, social interactions, or exercise. It is also released in response to drugs or other substances that
            are
            addictive.

        <h2>How to increase dopamine (in a healthy way)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Exercise: Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, has been shown to enhance dopamine production
                and release.
            </li>
            <li>Disconnect from phone</li>
            <li>Spend time in nature</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Dopamine fasting</li>
            <li>Listening to music</li>
            <li>Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation reduces dopamine receptors and release, so maintaining good sleep
                habits supports healthy dopamine levels.
            </li>
            <li>Healthy diet</li>
            <li>Reduce stress: Sleep deprivation reduces dopamine receptors and release, so maintaining good sleep
                habits supports healthy dopamine levels.
            </li>
            <li>In general, avoid too much and constant pleasure.</li>
            <li>Since dopamine is derived from the amino acid tyrosine, eating foods rich in tyrosine can support
                dopamine production. Foods like:

                Protein-rich foods: chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, dairy
                Soy products, almonds, avocados, and bananas
                Beans and seeds (like pumpkin seeds)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <details>
            <summary>
                How is dopamine produced in the body?
            </summary>

            <p>L-Tyrosine: The amino acid tyrosine, which comes from dietary protein, is the starting material for
                dopamine production. It's either obtained through food or synthesized from another amino acid called
                phenylalanine.</p>

            <p>Conversion to L-DOPA: Tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA (levodopa) by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.
                <b>This is the rate-limiting step</b>, meaning it's the slowest and most tightly regulated part of dopamine
                production.</p>

            <p>Conversion to Dopamine: L-DOPA is then converted into dopamine by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. Dopamine
                can then be stored in vesicles within neurons to be released when needed.</p>

        </details>

        <h2>What does NOT increase dopamin!</h2>

        <p><b>Stimulants like amphetamines</b> increase the release of dopamine but don’t directly increase its
            production in the long term. Overuse can actually reduce the brain's ability to produce dopamine naturally,
            leading to tolerance and dependence.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Base Level of Dopamine for Normal Function</h2>

        <p>There is indeed a base level of dopamine required for normal functioning, particularly in the brain. This base level is essential for:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Movement: Dopamine plays a critical role in regulating motor functions. A deficit of dopamine in specific brain regions, like the substantia nigra, leads to motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's, a significant loss of dopamine-producing neurons causes symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and difficulty initiating movements.</li>

        <li>Mood Regulation: Dopamine is closely tied to the brain’s reward and pleasure system. Adequate dopamine levels help regulate mood, motivation, and the ability to experience pleasure. Low dopamine is often linked to depression, lack of motivation, and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure).</li>

        <li>Cognitive Function: Dopamine is involved in processes like attention, learning, and memory. It helps regulate cognitive functions and executive processes in areas like the prefrontal cortex.</li>

        <li>Autonomic Nervous System Regulation: Dopamine helps regulate the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and blood pressure. It has a role in controlling the release of other hormones, like prolactin, through its inhibitory effect on the pituitary gland.</li>
        </ol>

            How Much Dopamine is Used?

            There’s no precise way to quantify how much dopamine is used per minute or hour, because dopamine use is highly dynamic and depends on the activity level of the brain. However, we can understand it in terms of relative processes:

            During active states (like problem-solving, enjoying music, eating, or exercise), dopamine release is elevated in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and reward system (e.g., the nucleus accumbens).
            During resting states, dopamine release is much lower but still occurs at a baseline level to maintain essential functions.

            Is There Constant Breakdown?

            Yes, there is constant dopamine turnover in the brain. Even during rest, dopamine is released and broken down, though at much lower levels than during active or stimulating tasks. The half-life of dopamine in the synapse is very short, often lasting just a few milliseconds to seconds before being reabsorbed or metabolized.
